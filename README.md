# Fork of Citation-X aircraft from PAFTEAM repository
I have forked the [Citation-X aicraft from PAFTEAM](https://sourceforge.net/p/pafteam/addons/ci/master/tree/Aircraft/CitationX/) in order to adapt it to my home cockpit.  
To do so, I followed the procedure described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24577084/forking-a-sub-directory-of-a-repository-on-github-and-making-it-part-of-my-own-r).
